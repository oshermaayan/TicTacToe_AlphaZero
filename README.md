## Tic Tac Toe heuristics estimation using trained models
This is an implementation of the AlphaZero algorithm for playing the simple board game Gomoku (also called Gobang or Five in a Row) from pure self-play training. The game Gomoku is much simpler than Go or chess, so that we can focus on the training scheme of AlphaZero and obtain a pretty good AI model on a single PC in a few hours.

### Instructions
TttBoardToScoreMaps.py is the main file you should use to extract score-boards from a given game board.
Other code files are in this repository mainly for future adaptions and additions.
